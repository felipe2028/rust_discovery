# `Discovery`

Discover the world of microcontrollers through [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)!

There are currently two versions of this book. The first is older and uses an
F3 Discovery circuit board to introduce you to microcontrollers and Rust, while
the second is newer and uses a micro:bit circuit board instead.

- [Read the newer book, using a micro:bit](https://docs.rust-embedded.org/discovery/microbit)
- [Read the older book, using an F3 discovery board](https://docs.rust-embedded.org/discovery/f3discovery)
- Start working on the examples from this repository
- You've got questions?
    - Have a look at our [discussions section on
      GitHub](https://github.com/rust-embedded/discovery/discussions)
    - Maybe it has already been answered
    - If not, start a new discussion
- You've found an issue?
    - Have a look at our [issues on
      GitHub](https://github.com/rust-embedded/discovery/issues)
    - Maybe there is already a workaround
    - If not, please open a new one - or even better - a [pull
      request](https://github.com/rust-embedded/discovery/pulls) for solving
      it
- Have fun and enjoy!
